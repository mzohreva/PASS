            We only consider your most recent submission for grading,
            if you want an earlier submission to be considered, you should
            re-submit your earlier solution.
        </li>
        <li>
            If your submission fails to compile you will not receive any
            credit for it.
        </li>
        <li>
            We only keep a few submissions for each user per assignment,
            older submissions are automatically deleted periodically.
        </li>
        <li>
            You should keep backup copies of your code.
        </li>
        <li>
            We strongly recommend using version control software such as
            <code>git</code> to keep a history of your changes as well as
            having redundant copies of your code repository on multiple
            machines. Learn git
            <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git" target="_blank">here</a>
            and
            <a href="https://try.github.io/" target="_blank">here</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
            If you use <code>GitHub</code> or similar services, make sure
            you don't make your code repository public.
            <code>GitHub</code> provides <mark>private</mark> repositories
            for students free of charge
            (<a href="https://education.github.com/pack"
